        <h2>What is sustainable agriculture?</h2>
        <p>
          Sustainable agriculture is farming in ways that meet society's food
          and textile needs without compromising the ability of current or
          future generations to meet their own needs. It aims to integrate
          ecological processes, reduce reliance on non-renewable inputs, and
          promote self-reliance among farmers.
        </p>

        <h2>How does sustainable agriculture help our farmers?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sustainable agriculture prioritizes maintaining and improving soil
            health. This involves practices such as crop rotation, cover
            cropping, reduced tillage, and organic matter additions to enhance
            soil fertility, structure, and water retention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Efficient water use is crucial in sustainable agriculture.
            Techniques like drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and using
            drought-resistant crops help conserve water resources.
